    % this is the computationally expensive bit, you can reduce it when the
    % number of samples gets large by selecting only the sensor
    % measurements that are in the local vicinity of the point you care
    % about. The idea being, snesor measurments from very different
    % attitudes, ect don't matter as much as sensor readings from nearby
    % the point of interest
    y_m = ks/(k+r)*y';
